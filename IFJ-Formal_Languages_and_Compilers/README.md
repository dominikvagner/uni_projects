# Compiler for IFJ21

### Description
In this team project the goal was to create a compiler for a imperative language (IFJ21, based on the Teal language).
The output was supposed to be in IFJcode21, assembly like language. The created compiler had to check all lexical, syntax
or semantics errors. 
Code available [here](https://github.com/IFJ017-2021/IFJ) or in the `repo_backup` folder.
