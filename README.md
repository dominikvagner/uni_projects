# University Projects
Collection of mine solutions to most of the projects I had (so far) at uni, that can be considered at least a bit presentable and make somewhat sense without the rest of the project skeleton supplied by the school. (Some of them still have skeletons missing.)

### Project descriptions
Projects are sorted by subjects.

Each subject should have a description of its projects (bigger projects have their own, else the subject has a README describing the projects in general) in its README file following format (some projects required their own README so these were kept and adjusted):

    Project title/subject.
    Simple description of project in English.
    Used or required technologies/languages/skills.
    Earned points.
