# MarkdownNotes
Project for IZA (Programming for Apple devices) subject.

## Description
MarkdownNotes is a document-based simple markdown editor, coded in Swift Playgrounds for iPad.

It doesn't yet support all possible markdown syntax,
it uses the AttributedString API from SwiftUI and
expands a little on the limited markdown support it has.
The supported functionality can be seen in the program help.

Above your keyboard should also pop-up a custom toolbar
for easier inserting of a few supported markdown syntax.
