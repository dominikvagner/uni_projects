# Filter Artifacts from Sound Recording 

### Description
In this project we had to filter 4 harmonically related cosine waves from a given sound.
For that we were required to analyze the singal, find on which frequencies are the cosines located and suggest a filter(s) for cleaning the singal and then apply them.
Project is implemented in Python Jupyter notebook. We also had to write a proper protocol for this project.

Cool demo you can look at is in the audio folder of this directory. Firstly listen to the xvagne10.wav which is the original recording given to us and then listen to clean_bandstop.wav which is the filtered one by me.
