# NumPy and Matplotlib

### Description
The goal of this project was to implement a couple of functions using NumPy, Matplotlib and BeautifulSoup to learn data manipulation and making graphs.
Tasks:

- Generate a matplotlib figure/graph for a predefined function with varied coeficients.
- Vizualization of a sinus signal.
- Download a HTML page and parse a table in it into dictionary.
- Going through the downloaded data.
